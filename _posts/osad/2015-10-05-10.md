Episode #10 of Half An Hour Of Improv With Ando was recorded at the Tallinn International Improv Festival [Tilt](http://improfestival.ee), on the 3rd of October, 2015.

The festival brings together local and international improvisers and offers performance, learning and networking opportunities to beginner, intermediate and experienced improvisers alike.

For episode #10: Tilt Workshop Instructors Special, I asked the workshop instructors of Tilt to sit with me for a small improvised jam session.

The workshop instructors are improvisers with a wealth of experience and knowledge and this was a chance to relax and let them play with each other.

_The recording contains mild profanities._
